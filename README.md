### *EC414 - Intro to Machine Learning*
**Semester:** Spring 2019 (Junior)

**Instructor:** Brian Kulis

**Course Description:** 
This course will introduce students to modern techniques of data analysis and machine learning.  The development and deployment of such tools has become an increasingly integral component in many domains.  For instance, Google now fundamentally relies on data analysis and machine learning to drive their businesses (as do many other companies); other enterprises such as those in bioinformatics, engineering, and finance have also been reshaped by the emergence of such tools.  It is increasingly important to equip students entering the workforce with the knowledge to be able to understand and employ these tools in a variety of contexts.  As such, this course will overview many of the basic tools of data analysis and machine learning---regression, classification, data visualization, and clustering---as well as touch upon some of the recent progress in this area, most notably deep learning and large-scale neural networks.  Further, the course will expose students to programming assignments involving real-world data.
