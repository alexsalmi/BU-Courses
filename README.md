# BU-Courses
A collection of programming homeworks and projects from my different classes at Boston University

## Courses

### *EC327 - Intro to Software Engineering*
**Semester:** Spring 2018 (Sophomore)

**Language:** C++

**Instructor:** Jeffrey Carruthers

**Course Description:**
This course aims to introduce students to software design, programming techniques, data structures, and software engineering principles. The course is structured bottom up, beginning with basic hardware followed by an understanding of machine language that controls the hardware and the assembly language that organizes that control. It then proceeds through fundamental elements of functional programming languages, using C as the case example, and continues with the principles of object-oriented programming, as principally embodied in C++ but also its daughter languages Java, C#, and objective C. The course will conclude with an introduction to elementary data structures and algorithmic analysis. Throughout, the course develops core competencies in software engineering, including programming style, optimization, debugging, compilation, and program management, utilizing a variety of Integrated Development Environments and operating systems.

### *EC330 - Applied Algorithms and Data Structures*
**Semester:** Fall 2018 (Junior)

**Language:** C++

**Instructor:** Wenchao Li

**Course Description:**
Introduction to the general concept of algorithms. Efficiency and run-time of algorithms. Graph algorithms, priority queues, search trees. Various approaches to design of algorithms and data structures, together with their applications to numerical and non-numerical problems.

___

### *EC413 - Computer Organization*
**Semester:** Spring 2019 (Junior)

**Languages:** Assembly, Verilog, C

**Instructor:** Michel Kinsy

**Course Description:**
Introduction to the fundamentals and design of computer systems. Topics covered include computer instruction sets, assembly language programming, arithmetic circuits, CPU design (data path and control, pipelining), performance evaluation, memory devices, memory systems including caching and virtual memory, and I/O. Project using design automation tools. Includes lab.

___

### *EC414 - Intro to Machine Learning*
**Semester:** Spring 2019 (Junior)

**Language:** Python/Jupyter Notebook

**Instructor:** Brian Kulis

**Course Description:**
This course will introduce students to modern techniques of data analysis and machine learning.  The development and deployment of such tools has become an increasingly integral component in many domains.  For instance, Google now fundamentally relies on data analysis and machine learning to drive their businesses (as do many other companies); other enterprises such as those in bioinformatics, engineering, and finance have also been reshaped by the emergence of such tools.  It is increasingly important to equip students entering the workforce with the knowledge to be able to understand and employ these tools in a variety of contexts.  As such, this course will overview many of the basic tools of data analysis and machine learning---regression, classification, data visualization, and clustering---as well as touch upon some of the recent progress in this area, most notably deep learning and large-scale neural networks.  Further, the course will expose students to programming assignments involving real-world data.

### *EC447 - Software Design*
**Semester:** Spring 2019 (Junior)

**Language:** C#

**Instructor:** Tom Skinner

**Course Description:**
Object-oriented software design for desktop applications with a graphical user interface. C# and Microsoft .NET programming assignments. Provides a solid foundation in modern programming for engineering and other applications.
