## Summary
We chose Oracle DNS for our provider and created a free trial account. We set up our own device as a local server, and configured the DDNS on  the linksys admin page but putting in the account information  and  the host name. We then went into the port forwarding tab to set up the port  for our hellow world server which was 8080.
