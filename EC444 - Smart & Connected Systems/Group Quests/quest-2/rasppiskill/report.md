#  Raspberry Pi

Author: Thuc Nguyen, 2019-10-08

## Summary
For this skill, I followed the directions for flashing the provided sd card with NOOBS and then inserted the sd card
into the Raspberry Pi Zero W and went through the installation process for Raspbian. After completing the installation, 
I configured the wifi settings and enabled SSH. I also installed NodeJS and repeated the initial "hello world" tutorial
on the raspberry pi.
