#  34-wheel_speed

Author: Karle Erf, 2019-11-11

## Summary
In this skill we had to use an optical encoder to determine the speed of the crawler. This was done by attaching an encoder pattern onto the inside of the back wheel of the crawler. The optical encoder was then used  to determine how many revolutions the wheel made. This is done by reading different levels of refelection by the LED. After finding a set number of revolutions over a time interval we were then able to convert that to meters per second and give an accurate speed for the crawler.
