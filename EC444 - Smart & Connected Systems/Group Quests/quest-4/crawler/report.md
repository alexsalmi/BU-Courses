#  29-crawler

Author: Karle Erf, 2019-11-11

## Summary
In this skill we used PWM to control the ESC DC motor on the crawler. In order to control the speed we had to calibrate the onboard ESC, this was done by setting  the high value, low value, and the neutral value on start up. Then the pwm can be set to vary the speed. In order to control the steering we used the same servo control as we did in the first quest.
