#  27-accelerometer

Author: Alex Salmi, 2019-10-24

## Summary
In this skill we used the accelerometer to sense how the esp was moving. This was done by wiring  up the accelerometer according to the diagram and using an i2c bus to read and write the registers on the sensor. Once we read the data from the accelerometer we convert those readings into angles measured in degrees.
