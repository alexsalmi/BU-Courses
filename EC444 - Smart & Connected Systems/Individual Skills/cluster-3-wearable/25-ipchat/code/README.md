# Code Readme

The code for the server can be found in server.js. To run it, navigate tot his folder and run node server.js.
All of the code except for client.c can be run directly from this folder. client.c can be run by copying its contents to another esp-idf main file (I use bink.c in the esp-idf tutorials) and using the idf.py commands.
