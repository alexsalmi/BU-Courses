## Summary
I successfully managed to set up the server and ESP to be able to send messages between each other and display them on their respective consoles.

## Sketches and Photos
Unfortunately I forgot to take screenshots while I set this up during class last week, and I currently don't have access to my group's router, so I can't provide evidence right now. 

## Modules, Tools, Source Used in Solution
I used the udp_client example from esp-idf and the example server code on whizzer in the ipchat brief as templates for my code.
