#  Skill 10 - Alphanumeric Display

Author: Alex Salmi, 2019-09-12

## Summary
I completed this task by having the UART wait for the user to input a character, and as soon as they do, the 14-segment display will immediately display this new character at the end of the display.
The display will be updated real-time as the user types.
