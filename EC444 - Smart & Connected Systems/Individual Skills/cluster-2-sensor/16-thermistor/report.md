#  Skill 16 - Thermistor

Author: Alexander Salmi, 2019-09-26

## Summary
I successfully managed to read the voltage from the thermistor using the ADC, convert it fairly accurately to degrees Celsius, and then print the current temperature reading to console.

## Modules, Tools, Source Used in Solution
I used my code from skill 15 (battery.c) as a template for this solution, converting the voltage output of the ADC to a temperature value using a formula found online.
