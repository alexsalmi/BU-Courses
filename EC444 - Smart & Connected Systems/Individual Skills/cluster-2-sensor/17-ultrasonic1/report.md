#  Skill 17 - Ultrasonic

Author: Alex Salmi, 2019-10-01

## Summary
I successfully managed to read the voltage from the ultrasonic sensor using the ADC, convert it fairly accurately to distance in mm(the output in the video below says cm, but it is actually mm), and then print the current distance reading to console.

## Modules, Tools, Source Used in Solution
I used my code from skill 16 (thermistor.c) as a template for this solution, converting the voltage output of the ADC to a distance value using a formula found online.
