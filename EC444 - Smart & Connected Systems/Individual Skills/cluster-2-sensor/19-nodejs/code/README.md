# Code Readme

All of the code (and node modules) related to the w3schools tutorials can be found in the w3_tutorial_files folder.

The code for reading data from the thermistor and outputting it to console using nodejs can be found directly in the code folder. All of the code except for temperature.c can be run directly from this folder. Thermistor.c can be run by copying its contents to another esp-idf main file (I use bink.c in the esp-idf tutorials) and using the idf.py commands. 

Remember to run npm install before running a nodejs file that has dependencies.
