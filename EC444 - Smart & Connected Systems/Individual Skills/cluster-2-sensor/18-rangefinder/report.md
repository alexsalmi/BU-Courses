#  Skill 18 - Rangefinder

Author: Alex Salmi, 2019-10-01

## Summary
I successfully managed to read the voltage from the IR sensor using the ADC, convert it fairly accurately to distance in cm, and then print the current distance reading to console.

## Modules, Tools, Source Used in Solution
I used my code from skill 17 (ultrasonic.c) as a template for this solution, converting the voltage output of the ADC to a distance value using a formula found online.
