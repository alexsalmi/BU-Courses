# Code Readme

All of the nodejs code for this task can be found in database.js.
The file contains code to save the data from the smoke.txt file into the database, but since I have already done this, it is commented out for now.
As currently constructed, when you run the database.js file, it will prompt you to enter a sensor ID (1 to 5), and will output all of the sensor values for this ID found in the database.

To run the database.js file, simply navigate into this folder, run npm install && npm install tingodb, then finally run node database.js

The database itself can be found in /database/smoke_data
