#  37-ircomm

Author: Alex Salmi, 2019-11-22

## Summary
I successfully managed to set up the IR communication. Using uart, an H-bridge, and RMT, a signal of either "red", "green", or "blue" was transmitted from the transmitter, with the reciever reading this signal and toggling the corresponding LED.

## Sketches and Photos
I forgot to take a video before dissasembling the circuit to start on the quest, so here is my teammate Karle's video showing the same results:
