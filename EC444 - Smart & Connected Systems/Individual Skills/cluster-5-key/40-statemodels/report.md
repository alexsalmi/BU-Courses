Author: Alex Salmi, 2019-11-22

## Summary
I was successfully able to model the given situation using a state model, as well as show the model in state table form. There are four states: locked, message recieved, verification, unlocked. Based on the transfer of the message, and verification acceptance, the state will change according to the model/table shown below.
